## Counterpact Lobby Server
- **Languages Used:** C#
- **Development Period:** April 2022
- **Personal Project**
- [Repository](https://github.com/InvestigatorMelodytchi/cpactlobby)

The Counterpact Lobby Server was developed for a game I am currently working on in my spare time. The server serves little function on its own, and must work with HTTP requests sent by the game. The lobby server handles game server registration, as well as returning a list of servers to players who view the server browser in-game.



## Where She's From
- **Languages Used:** C
- **Development Period:** March 2019
- **Personal Project**
- [Repository](https://github.com/InvestigatorMelodytchi/wsf/tree/master/WHERESHESFROM)

Where She's From is an original hack-and-slash game developed specifically for the Ardubody, an Arduino-based handheld game system with very limited power. The game features 15 levels, varying enemies, and text intermissions between each level. Being my first full Arduboy game, there was a considerable amount I learned about memory management (for example, certain planned features, such as a sniper enemy, had to be cut due to memory constraints).



## Tamagolfi
- **Languages Used:** JavaScript, HTML5, CSS
- **Development Period:** September 2017
- **Personal Project** *(Unfinished)*

Tamagolfi is a game primarily utilizing JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas. It is a simplified golf game with an emphasis on planning the shot trajectory well. Though the game is technically unfinished, it is still playable.



## TamaHotel

TamaHotel is a game primarily utilizing JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas. It is an easy game in which the player takes care of their hotel guests. This game was developed as the final project for an Advanced Web Design class.



## SQL Database
- **Languages Used**: SQL
- **Development Period**: April 2016
- **Class Project (Final)**
- [Repository](https://github.com/MelodytchiMuseum/sqlproject)

This SQL database was created as my term project for a Database Systems class. Though it was a group project, I myself had planned out the database and laid down most of the groundwork. There are also 3 queries at the end of the file that I had developed per the project requirements.



## Awesomacro
- **Languages Used**: C#
- **Development Period**: February 2016
- **Personal Project**

This is a very simple HTML website that utilized CSS to keep the style consistent between pages. It was developed as a midterm project for a Web Design class.



## Risk Map
- **Languages Used**: C#
- **Development Period**: February 2014 - May 2014
